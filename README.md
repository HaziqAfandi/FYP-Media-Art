Topic : Loss of Hope

Hope is just a word with 4 letters that have no power to it unless there is an action taken or plan to fulfill one's desire. Everyone can have differnet kind of opinion of what hope is. Does not matter if it is big, small, realistic, temporary or permanent as long as it is achievable, that is hope. But sometimes not everything that we hope for will turns out to what we want. Either it did not seems to be as expected or it turns out completely different. This can call as loss of hope.
# Project Argument
Losing hope in what we have been believing we could achieve can lead into depression.
# Project Statement
Depression occurs when we felt unmotivated due to our ‘loss of hope’. Motivation can happen by believing the capabilities of ourselves and the support from the closest and the loved one.
# Background Research
Motivation of hope
1. How Loss of Hope Happens
- Loss of hope happened when usually when we already execute it and there’s an obstacle coming to stop you and try to bring you down. 
- Usually loss of hope occurs when there is a small amount of time left for someone to fulfil what they have been hope for. By this means the person felt pressure as the obstacles kept on coming. 
2. Behaviour from loss of hope
- Usually when we have been dealing with loss of hope stage, we will be thinking that it is really a bad thing and what worse could happen then.
- We have been practice in our mindset that when bad things happen, all the bad thoughts and outcomes will appears.
- But a hopeful person look to this case differently in such a vice versa way as when bad things happen, they will know and plan out everything to ease everything through in order to continue the journey to fulfil what they have been hope for.
- A hopeful person change their behaviour by knowing that they are not alone.
- A hopeful person are opened to share the problems or depression that they have been through to other people and not to be alone and keep it to self.
- From this, motivation can happens and slowly changed the behaviour towards good sides.
3. Motivation
- Motivation can be defined as the driving force behind all the actions of an individual.
- The influence of an individual's needs and desires both have a strong impact on how they act towards behaviour.
- By having motivation, we can see a clearer vision to what we have already planned.
- Motivation affect our feelings and emotions where it can change someone from negative things to positive things.
- Words from the one that we love or from the closest such as parents for example can somehow give us the motivational spirit.
- This happen due to that we trust these people and we tend to believe in them in order to believe in ourselves.
- The result from this motivation can makes us more matured and grown up as we can actually be more independent and plan well for the future.
